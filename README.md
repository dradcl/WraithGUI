# Game Installation
This mod functions on the last Mono version of the game because it relies on direct editing of Assembly-Csharp.dll.  

- Note: You **must** own this game on Steam to proceed with this method, I don't condone pirating of games.  

**How to install**:  
1. Download the latest release of [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader/releases) and extract it to a folder  
2. Download "PhasDownloader.bat" from this repo, put it in the same folder as the DepotDownloader files, right-click the bat, select edit, and add your Steam username and password next to their respective arguments ``-username`` and ``-password`` (Your credentials are not logged or vulnerable by doing this)  
3. Run the batch file and if you have Steam Guard on it will ask for a 2FA code. If not, it should automatically start to download  
4. Afterwards, it should create a ``depots`` folder and contained within it is your game installation. Mine was named a bunch of numbers so I assume it always is.

# Mod Installation
1. Follow the "Automated Installation" instructions for MelonLoader [here](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements)  
2. Download both DLLs from the [DLLs folder](https://github.com/karmakittenx/WraithGUI/tree/main/DLLS)  
3. Open your game folder to this directory ``Phasmophobia_Data\Managed`` and drag + replace those DLLs in  
4. Put the latest [WraithGUI](https://github.com/karmakittenx/WraithGUI/releases) in the ``Mods\`` folder.
5. Launch the game, start a level, click F1, and enjoy!
